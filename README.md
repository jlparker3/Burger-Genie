# Purpose
The purpose of this application is to allow the user to get burger options from the mysql database, input their burger selection, devour said burger, and delete that specific burger option. As the user adds burger options to the database the id number will increminate by one. With the use of CRUD operations, Burger Genie will grant your wish on whichever burger you would like. 

# My experience 
After understanding the file structure, I enjoyed my time watching the application come to life using CRUD operations. I decided to experiement with the UI of the app so it's appealing for the user to interact with. I kept the design of the application simple but clean and easy to use.
